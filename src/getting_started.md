# Getting Started

Let's start your Dawn journey! There's a lot to learn; in this chapter, we will learn to:

- Install the Dawn (`dwn`) executable
- Create a simple `Hello, world!` program and run it.

> Note: Replace `<path to dawn program directory>` with the location where you want to store your Dawn (`dwn`) program file. Also replace `<path to executable>` with the location of the Dawn (`dwn`) executable
