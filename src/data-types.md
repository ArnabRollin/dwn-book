# Data Types

There are 4 data types in Dawn:

| Data Types  | Meaning                                               |
|------------ |------------------------------------------------------ |
| int         | Integers (all numbers except decimals and fractions)  |
| float       | All decimals, fractions and integers                  |
| string      | The value between quotation marks                     |
| boolean     | `true` / `false`                                      |

**NOTE**: `int`s take up less memory that `float`s and thus are more efficient.
